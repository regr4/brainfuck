# brainfuck
A short and simple array-based python interpreter for BF.

To use it, copy it and use the bash command: 

python path/to/brainfuck.py path/to/bf/code.

I don't know whether you can do this on windows, I don't have a way to check and I'm not familiar with its Command Prompt.
It should work on macOS and hopefully, Linux
